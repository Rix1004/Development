    <h2>The Story</h2>
  
    <h3>Clark:</h3>
    <blockquote>“There’s no problem. I was just hoping you might give me some insight into the evolution of the market economy in the early colonies. <br>
      My contention is that prior to the Revolutionary War, the economic modalities, especially in the southern colonies, <br>
      could most aptly be characterized as agrarian precapitalist.”</blockquote>
   
    <h3>Will:</h3>
    <blockquote>“All right, of course that’s your contention. You’re a first-year grad student. You just finished some Marxian historian, Pete Garrison probably, <br>
      and so naturally that’s what you believe until next month when you get to James Lemon, and then you’re gonna be talking about how the economies of <br>
      Virginia and Pennsylvania were entrepreneurial and capitalist way back in 1740. <br>
      That’s gonna last until next year; you’re gonna be in here regurgitating Gordon Wood, talking about, you know, <br>
      the pre-revolutionary utopia and the capital-forming effects of military mobilization.”</blockquote>
  
    <h3>Clark:</h3>
    <blockquote>“Well, as a matter of fact, I won’t, because Wood drastically underestimates the impact of social distinctions predicated upon wealth, <br>
      especially inherited wealth.”</blockquote>
  
    <h3>Will:</h3>
    <blockquote>“You got that from Vickers, ‘Work in Essex County,’ page 98, right? Yeah, I read that too. <br>
      Were you gonna plagiarize the whole thing for us? Do you have any thoughts of your own on this matter? <br>
      Or is that your thing—you come into a bar, you read some obscure passage, and then pretend you pawn it off as your own idea <br> 
      just to impress some girls, embarrass my friend?”</blockquote>
  
    <h3>Will (continuing):</h3>
    <blockquote>“See, the sad thing about a guy like you is in 50 years you’re gonna start doing some thinking on your own, <br>
      and you’re gonna come up with the fact that you dropped 150 grand on an education you could have got for $1.50 in late charges at the public library.”</blockquote>
  
    <h3>Clark:</h3>
    <blockquote>“Yeah, but I will have a degree, and you’ll be serving my kids fries at a drive-through on our way to a skiing trip.”</blockquote>
  
    <h3>Will:</h3>
    <blockquote>“Yeah, maybe. But at least I won’t be unoriginal.”</blockquote>
