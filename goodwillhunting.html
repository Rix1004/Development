  <h2>The Story</h2>
  
  <h3>Harvard Student (HS):</h3>
  <p>“So, yeah, I mean, once you understand the DOM and how to manipulate it with JavaScript <br>
     everything else is just layering functionality. <br>
     Of course, that’s if you’ve already mastered semantic HTML and responsive CSS, <br>
     which, you know, can take years of dedicated study.”</p>
 
  <h3>Will:</h3>
  <p>“Or, you could just learn it all in a few months if you’re not wasting your time sounding <br>
     like an overpriced Udemy course.”</p>

  <h3>HS:</h3>
  <p>“Oh, really? And you think you know better? Why don’t you enlighten us?”</p>

  <h3>Will:</h3>
  <p>“Sure. What you just said about ‘mastering semantic HTML’? <br>
    That’s from HTML & CSS: Design and Build Websites by Jon Duckett. Chapter 2, right? <br>
    You probably skimmed it last night so you could sprinkle the word ‘semantic' into a conversation and sound informed. <br>
    Then you tacked on JavaScript because you saw a thread on Reddit where someone mentioned how <br>
    ‘you can’t just write HTML and CSS anymore, bro.’ Am I getting warm?”</p>

  <h3>HS:</h3>
  <p>“Well, uh—”</p>

  <h3>Will (cutting him off):</h3>
  <p>“And as for ‘responsive CSS,’ you’re probably parroting some Bootstrap tutorial on YouTube. <br>
    Let me guess—grid system blew your mind, huh? But you still can’t write a media query without <br>
    copying and pasting one from Stack Overflow.”</p>

  <h3>HS (defensive):</h3>
  <p>“Hey, look, man—”</p>

  <h3>Will (leaning in):</h3>
  <p>“No, see, the problem here isn’t learning to code. <br>
     It’s that you’re too busy dropping buzzwords to impress people instead of writing actual code. <br>
     You think reading the first few chapters of a textbook makes you a developer? <br>
     Here’s the thing: you could’ve learned everything you just said for free by opening Mozilla’s MDN docs or doing the tutorials on freeCodeCamp. <br>
     But no, you’re too busy paying $10,000 for a bootcamp so they can give you a certificate no one will ever ask for.”</p>
