    <img class="focus-pic" src="images/will.webp" alt="Will Hunting">
    <p id="focus"><span style=font-family:FS-Me-Bold;>Will Hunting</span> is a brilliant yet troubled young man from South Boston with a natural gift for mathematics and an eidetic memory. <br>
      Despite his extraordinary intelligence, Will works as a janitor at MIT and struggles with his past trauma and emotional vulnerability. <br>
      His life takes a transformative turn when he solves a complex math problem left by a professor, attracting the attention of renowned mathematician Gerald Lambeau. <br>
      Through court-mandated therapy sessions with psychologist Sean Maguire, Will confronts his fears, builds meaningful relationships, <br>
      and begins to unlock his true potential, all while grappling with the complexities of his identity and future.</p>
